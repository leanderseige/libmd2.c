1. INTRODUCTION

I needed a MD2 model loader and could find only C++ ones so I decided
to write my own in C. Here it is.
It is close to be a real library but I'm too lazy for now to make the
necessary changes. For now it's only a C file you can include in your
project.


2. FEATURES

- loading MD2 models
- loading textures from a wide range of file formats
- three different kinds of normal calculation
- dynamic bounding box calculation
- render with or without texturing, as points or wireframe
- arbitrary keyframe interpolation
- handles the usual MD2 animation sequences
- texture independent from model, load multiple textures per model


3. REQUIREMENTS

libmd2.c is based on OpenGL and SDL, you need both to make it work.
It loads the model by an own model loader and the textures via SDL_image,
so make sure you have SDL_image installed. 
Of course you need all these libraries also with their devel packages.
The sample programs make use of OpenGL extensions and assumes silently
that they are present (for instance GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE_NV).


4. INSTALLATION

Download and unpack the archive. Move to the directory and call the
compile.sh shell script. It contains my commands to compile both
sample applications, so you probably have to change it to make it
work on your system.

- md2view displays the md2 model, read its output on the terminal to
  know how it works. 

- md2info dumps some information about a model file to the terminal.

To use libmd2.c in your own projects just copy the libmd2.c file to the
source directory of your project and include it from your source
files like it is done in the sample applications.

5. TECHNICAL INFO

The necessary information about the MD2 file format was obtained from:

http://tfc.duke.free.fr/old/models/md2.htm and
http://gpwiki.org/index.php/MD2

The libmd2.c uses triangle-by-triangle rendering or fans/strips (glcommands)
depending on which normal calculation was requested.
Probably the rendering can still be accelerated by using arrays for vertex,
texture coordinates or normal information. But it's pretty fast already.

per face normals:
     all three vertices of a triangle have the same normal vector,
     suitable for hard models like robots or so

per vertex normals:
    the calculation of a normal of a vertex involves all triangles
    the vertex is member of, suitable for smooth round models like human
    beings
    
average normals:
    the average of per vertex and per face normals
